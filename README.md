# Java Deep Learning Solutions [Video]
This is the code repository for [Java Deep Learning Solutions [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/java-deep-learning-solutions-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788396059), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this course, you start by installing Deep Learning software for Java. You learn how to use the DL4J library and apply Deep Learning to a range of real-world use cases. The course will take you into Neural Networks, working with Perceptron, XOR, and Gradient Descent on code examples. It then covers Convolutional Networks with extraction, Max pooling, and Softmax. You'll get hands-on with working examples at the end of each section. It also covers Recurrent Neural Network, explaining all the features of its Architecture. Finally, you'll learn about Word2Vec's different models and how to work with them via practical examples.
